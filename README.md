## Installation

### Homebrew
Before starting development, you should have Homebrew installed in order to continue setting up BaseApp iOS V2 locally. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. To install, run the following command:
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Ruby
Before installing Fastlane and CocoaPods, you will need the correct version of Ruby. For installing and managing different versions of Ruby on your local machine, we recommend using [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/). Begin with the following command:
```
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
```
Then run the following command to install RVM:
```
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```
If the previous step is successful, run the following command to install Ruby 2.3.1:
```
$ rvm install ruby-2.3.1
```
Now run the following command to check that the correct version is being used:
```
$ ruby -v
```
The version reported should look like this:
```
ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin15]
```

### Fastlane
You will need Fastlane installed in order to test sending out builds locally and generating push certificates. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ gem install fastlane
```

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

### SwiftLint
You will need SwiftLint installed in order to check all avaliables or utlize any of its autocorrect features. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ brew install swiftlint
```

### Setup
After installing SwiftLint, use the following command to clone the repo:
```
$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:silverlogic/baseapp-ios-v2.git
```
Then run the following command to install the dependencies, and open the project in Xcode:
```
$ make open_xcode
```
